# Portfolio Growth Calculator
The portfolio growth calculator is an open-source python script that helps an individual determine how much they
should roughly save in order to meet financial goals. This is done by using collected historical returns of the
S+P 500 Index and Long Returns. While this is not a perfect way to determine the performance of your unique portfolio it provides
a much better idea of market volatility than assuming a standard rate of return. Each 'year' that is calculated
is done so with a randomly chosen year from the historical data text files. If you would like to see the data I am using there is a spreadsheet included with all of my numbers. If you would like to use your own numbers simply change the StockHistory.txt/BondHistory.txt to your liking.
