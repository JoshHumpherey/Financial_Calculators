# Portfolio Growth Calculator
The portfolio growth calculator is an open-source python script that helps an individual determine how much they 
should roughly save in order to meet financial goals. This is done by using collected historical returns of the
S+P 500 Index. While this is not a perfect way to determine the performance of your unique porfolio it provides
a much better idea of market volatility than assuming a standard rate of return. Each 'year' that is calculated
is done so with a randomly chosen year from the historical data text file. In the future I would like to add both
historical bond data and a standard rate of inflation for a more accurate account of growth depending on your
portfolio allocations.
